# ðŸ“Š PyTorch Diffusion Model for Stanford Cars Dataset ðŸš— ðŸš‚


This project implements a simple minimalist diffusion model in PyTorch ðŸ”¥ and integrates with the W&B platform ðŸ’» for experiment tracking and visualization ðŸ“ˆ. The model is trained on the Stanford Cars dataset ðŸš™ and is designed for image generation tasks.



# ðŸ“ˆ What is a diffusion model?

A diffusion model is a type of generative model that learns to generate samples from a target distribution by gradually spreading probability mass from a simple base distribution through a series of diffusion steps. The diffusion process allows the model to capture complex dependencies between variables, making it well-suited to tasks such as image generation and denoising.

# ðŸ’» Installation
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using pip:


```git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
cd your_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# ðŸ”¥ Usage
To train the diffusion model on the Stanford Cars dataset, simply run the following command:


```
python train.py --epochs 100 --lr 0.0005 --batch_size 16 --device cuda

```

This will start the training process and log metrics to W&B for easy tracking and visualization.
 

# ðŸ“ˆ Experiment Tracking
This project integrates with W&B for experiment tracking and visualization. You can view your experiment runs in the W&B dashboard ðŸ“Š by logging in with your W&B account credentials:

```wandb login
```

You can then view your experiment runs in the dashboard by navigating to the project page and selecting the relevant runs.
